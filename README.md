## Use Case

This plugin can help you easily see what kind of models you have stored away under obscured file names in folders; discover if you have any hidden gems you've forgotten about!
You can easily group similar objects into new collections and export them right away.
As I used this tool, I quickly realized how many empty collections you create by regrouping objects, so I added a nice little "Delete Empty Collections" button.

### Potential Issues
Sometimes your meshes may have a pink texture issue. You can either reassign the texture, or attempt to recover the source texture though:
File > External Data > Find Missing Files
Whenever I have this issue, this fix immediately solves my issues.
