## Use Case

This plugin can help you easily see what kind of models you have stored away under obscured file names in folders; discover if you have any hidden gems you've forgotten about!
You can easily group similar objects into new collections and export them right away.
There's a "Delete Empty Collections" Button to clear up the old collections after you regroup your assets.

## Features

### Import

After selecting a folder containing ".blend" files, all objects from the files will be imported into your current project in a grid-like formation. You can specify the number of projects' collections to be in a row before the next row is started.

### Export

Select a collection to export to a brand new Blender file.

### Delete Empty Collections

Remove any unwanted, empty collections immediately with this button.

### Potential Issues
Sometimes your meshes may have a pink texture issue. You can either reassign the texture, or attempt to recover the source texture though:
File > External Data > Find Missing Files
Whenever I have this issue, this fix immediately solves my issues.

Sometimes the spacing is slightly off and creates an incomplete grid with some of the imported groups being slightly out of place.
