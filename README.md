## Use Case

This plugin can help you easily see what kind of models you have stored away under obscured file names in folders; discover if you have any hidden gems you've forgotten about!
You can easily group similar objects into new collections and export them right away.
As I used this tool, I quickly realized how many empty collections you create by regrouping objects, so I added a nice little "Delete Empty Collections" button.

### Potential Issues
Sometimes your meshes may have a pink texture issue. You can either reassign the texture, or attempt to recover the source texture though:
File > External Data > Find Missing Files
Whenever I have this issue, this fix immediately solves my issues.

Sometimes the spacing is slightly off and creates an incomplete grid with some of the imported groups being slightly out of place.
